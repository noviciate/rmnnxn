# Hello, I'm Roman and...

I'm a UX designer in training. Maybe we can work together on something in the future but until then, I am currently:

- Tinkering with Framer and Figma
- Working through the Google UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera
- Participating in user testing studies
- Presenting my work to you right here as I progress

Wish me luck on my journey!
