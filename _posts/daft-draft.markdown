The land between Niagara Falls and Rochester is quite flat, save for occasional dips and inclines. It slopes gently downward toward Lake Ontario. Wooded areas are mostly privately owned with young, stick-like trees and densly packed shrubery. Farmland is mostly corn, grains and cabbage, but there are also many fruit orchards and livestock.

I think that there are moments of beauty or visual intrigue to be had if you have a feel for subtlty. Old barns, silos and farmhouses sit proud atop gentle hills. There are many creeks that flow north and join together before draining into Lake Ontario. The dips and and open fields hold the morning fog of spring and autumn. The orchards in spring hold acres of blossoms. The harvest season has it's own beauty as leaves turn color and farm stands have endless varieties of pumpkins and gourds. Winter inundates the scenery with fluffy "lake effect" snow.

These atributes are shared on the north side in Ontario, Canada and likely throughout the Great Lakes. One thing that does make this area unique are the Field Stone, Carpenter Gothic and Victorian style houses you occasionally come across and I might explore some of that in a future series.
