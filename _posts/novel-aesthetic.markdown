If you are like me, you turn to art and music for mental stimulation and you enjoy works that you can find new aspects in upon subsequent viewings/listenings. If this is not you, save your time and close this tab. I am not and do not claim to be an expert in photography or any other visual media. This is not a guide on how to impress clients or achieve the look that is trending on social media. Also, I am specifically presenting an antonym to the garish.

#Accidentally New Topographics
I began my recent interest in photography as a "mission creep" away from painting. I was initially recording textures and scenes for practice and inspiration while riding my bike around the Rochester metro area. I began to pay close attention to composition and decided to start using a forgotten SLR camera that was in the family instead of just my smartphone, a Minolta Maxxum with an unshot roll of Kodak Gold 200 in the pocket of its bag.

Riding around, my gaze falls upon the various anachronisms in the Rochester landscape. I found satisfaction in unifying the elements of the scene within my viewfinder, whether in the exurbs, the parks or the city proper. My disappointments with what is around me and within myself can be turned into something productive.

Unwittingly, the themes I covered were not unlike those found in works by photographers of the [New Topographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Topographics) exhibition who found [beauty in the banal](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/08/new-topographics-photographs-american-landscapes).

You see strikingly similar photos when you view certain hashtags on Instagram, particularly in the analog photography communities.  Because the subjects have since taken over or otherwise gathered patina and have been accepted as part of the scene for several decades, the new generation is capturing feelings of nostalgia instead of coming to terms with what was once a new blight on a disappearing natural landscape[^1]. It would be nice to build on top of all this and move beyond nostalgia to create a novel aesthetic[^2]  [^3].

I had already begun writing this post before I added this section about New Topographics. Robert Adams mentions in this short video some of the things I attempted to explain in subsequent paragraphs.

* Beauty is a "...unified, balanced, coherent *whole*"
* "...luminance, radiance over this landscape of mistakes."
* "wholeness in the picture is a metaphor for wholeness in life"

# Prime subject is not alone
Typically, there is a specific *noun* that is the focus of your image. This prime subject does not exist in a vacuum and it's important to reveal its context. This is why the rule of thirds is a useful exercise to think about ... so rather than having the subject dead center, you have it a third of the way into the image. Two thirds of the image now lies beside the subject. However, placing the subject a third of the way into the image is not always (or even typically) the best place for it. But the awareness of the context and the secondary or tertiary objects in the scene is essential and a rule of composition helps you think about them, even when you end up not using the rule per se.

# Elevate the mundane and make ordinary that which is exalted
Straight shots of prominent landmarks in national parks and world capital cities are not enough for us. To get our scoop, we look for the small town aspect of the big city and highlight the novelties of a small city. We explore the "natural" scenes and parks that are in our locality. What is celebrated and what is inconspicuous, the gritty and pretty are all treated as equals because we are not working for the tourism board.

![Rochester skyline from Mt Hope Cemetery](/images/photos/urban/4.jpg){:style="width: 50%; margin-left: 0%; float: left; padding-right: 5px;" onclick="myFunction(this);"} <span style="color: grey; font-style: italic;">All descend toward midtown, the sky with shelved clouds and the gently sloping hill below. Towers that were formerly the headquarters of influencial companies mirror the tombstones of Mt Hope Cemetery, the resting place of once prominent people who called the city their home. The trees flank either side of the scene like stage curtains. Mt Hope Cemetery was once rural and despite subsequent urban/suburban development, Rochester still retains some green spaces and many trees (though the natural wetland environment of the area has largely been destroyed since the arrival of settlers but that is another story).</span>
  
# Layers
Imagine a village in the valley of a mountain range. A lake or river wraps around the village and the sky holds puffy clouds. Maybe a church steeple breaks through and becomes a visual anchor. There are converging angles from the slopes as one wedges into another. Reduce this image into an arrangement of polygons. Your mountains, village or your steeple are an ever-present metaphor and you can compose your work with as much complexity as that Alpine scene, no matter the subject.

# Time and season agnostic
Every weather condition and time of day has something to offer and that includes a cloudy day or bright and sunny midday. The image of downtown Rochester as viewed from Mt Hope Cemetery was shot midday and I think this serves it well.

Take a couple examples from nature: after their foliage falls off for winter, the colorful shoots of red twig dogwoods are revealed. The color pops amongst other shrubery on cloudy or wet days. Also, you get juicy moss and metallic lichen on trees and forest floors popping out at you because the trunks and the soil darken from the moisture of rainfall or snowmelt. Think about what else might pop out on an otherwise "gloomy" day. Maybe the subject you have in mind has less to compete with and is better showcased in such conditions.

Conversely, I think my photo of the faded American flag on the shoddy shed (later in the page) was best shot in the afternoon, during the early part of the *golden hour*. That photo also benefits from being shot in the *spring/summer cusp* because the foliage is present but not fully developed. Areas would be blocked by the lush foliage of summer and the lack of foliage in winter would make the image more bleak than I intended it to be.

# Raison d'être
You have a means of communicating ideas visually with complexity and subtlety. A volume control for art in an age where privacy is no longer valued.[^4] You can subvert the mores of the acquisitive and incurious without offending them, they move on and forget about you.

Not everything you capture has to be pre-meditated with meaning and purpose. The process can be like browsing goods, where a random item intrigues you. You then play around with it and maybe you walk away with something. Sometimes it's aparent that it has puropose and sometimes it is not—the meaning may be discovered when you view the work afterwards. You can come up with something great on a whim or with planning.[^3]

Fine art serves a purpose akin to what research and expirementation does in science. The difference being that art is concerned with explanation through representation rather than explanation through proof.

Embrace the fact that your work is a drop in an ocean of other works more successful in their reach and reward.

# Thoughts on equipment
How sharp your image needs to be is directly related to how effective the meaning of your photo is conveyed in the final image. Impressionistic or Hyper-real are means to an end.

Film, digital and the various formats of each are not at odds. They all offer something the others lack. See how great 35mm professional film stock looks when they are properly scanned and edited in a lossless file format. It's senseless to hold your nose up at different sized sensors, films or how new or old a camera is.

You may already know that a prime lens often renders a sharper and less distorted image than what a lot of zoom lenses have to offer - but a good zoom lens is better than a prime lens in an inadequate focal length.

![pink flower cluster in early spring](/images/photos/flowers/IMG_20200408_143254_167.jpg){:style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" onclick="myFunction(this);"} <span style="color: grey; font-style: italic;">Orb-like flower with transluscent edges because most of the image is out of focus except for the shard-like petals of the second flower. The third flower plays shadow to the second, yet offers its stigma prominently. The outline of the cluster spells OK. Taken on a grey day in the early spring in Highland Park Rochester, NY.</span>

![backyard with faded flag](/images/photos/rural/2020_0703_03052500-01.jpeg){:style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" onclick="myFunction(this);"} <span style="color: grey; font-style: italic;">Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better to focus directly on the wall with the flag. I suppose I feel like for this photo and for the meaning I wanted to bring accross, it would be less interesting in its directness and misleading about the context. You have the obvious metaphor of the faded flag as people talk of America's power and influence fading but you miss the broader perspective. There is a whole neighborhood. There are those lawn chairs and a devilish figure in the window behind them, seemingly waiting for the next lighting of the firepit. You also see some structures have much neater siding than others. And what is the semi-circle the flag is mounted over anyways, the long since forgotten backboard from a basketball hoop?</span>

Please read these **footnotes** for more indepth understanding of the mentioned topics:

[^1]: Not long after writing that sentence, I found a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/g416as/new_topographics_cliche_or_not_why/) where users compare New Topographics to influencer film photographers.
[^2]: *Before moving beyond New Topographics:* here are some [notes](https://lyndakuitphotographylandscape.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/new-topographics-landscapes-the-west-irony-critique-in-new-topographic-photography-2005/) of a [source paper](https://americansuburbx.com/2012/05/new-topographics-landscape-and-the-west-irony-and-critique-in-new-topographic-photography-2005.html) that highlights aspects and critiques of NT. Though, I think there is an over-emphasis on photos of Western America when NT is discussed, considering not every photo was from there. The over-arching theme was the interest in "man-altered landscapes". The emphasis on the *West* was likely because the perceived message resonated with others the most after viewing the photos of said region.
