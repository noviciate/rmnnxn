*... as it pertains to the west side of Rochester in Monroe and Orleans counties.*

The land is flat, save for occasional dips and inclines while sloping gently downward toward Lake Ontario, due north. Wooded areas are mostly privately owned---with young, stick-like trees and densely packed shrubbery. All between and beyond the interstices of suburban development.

I think that there are scenes of visual intrigue to be had here, if you have a feel for subtlety.
