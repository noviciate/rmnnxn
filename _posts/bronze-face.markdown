 *Ideas behind the work*
 
Preposterous lighting is a stylistic choice to further the work into abstraction. The highlights of the face do not correspond with the glowing orb in the bottom left corner. The nostril is absurdly luminescent. 

I tried to demonstrate how visuals are (re)created in the mind. Thoughts have plasticity. When you try to imagine someone's face, the rendering adapts to your feelings and presuppositions that may or may not be accurate.

In english, when we refer to the smiley emoji, it is gender neutral. However, one may in their mind default to it as male, particularly when compared to the kiss emoji. I am setting this up for the following reason: people have assumed that "Bronze Face" is a self-portrait of me. This is not the case. I used a female model in a Louis Vuitton ad in Vogue as a reference for my initial sketch. The model was quite clearly a woman, but when the face is abstracted to a significant degree, it becomes ambiguous or misleading.
