*Insight into method and progression*

Our mental image of a person is based on an array of assumptions. Our mind is pliable and so our preconceptions can shift over time or in a given moment, ultimately altering our image of the person. This is why I am drawn to creating these semi-abstract "portraits". *These ideas also inform the creative choices in my photography and I will save that for another post.*

*Work in progress. I smudge my way to the proper form over time, allowing layers to dry a bit between each go. Oil on paper.*



I had erroneously thought that working on stretched canvas would make a more "proper" painting. I also thought that I had to give off some sense of hubris (even if I myself was not filled with it) by painting larger and I have since quashed this notion. 

Paper can be cheaper, immediate, and therefore serves well as a preliminary support. There are also physical shortcomings based on the nature of paper that I assume you can imagine. I think I was misguided to think that these shortcomings and its preliminary usage would be a poor choice...to the contrary. Heavyweight paper and a good acrylic priming make it suitable for oil. 

I want to be able to move between digital, charcoal and oil easily and in an indeterminate order. This ambiguous, media agnostic approach meshes better with my thought process. I am thinking of each painting in a way that is like an app that has updates and revisions. There are releases, versions, forks, patches, etc.

And so "solstice" is not done but even when it's finished, it will still be a work in progress in a sense. Much in the same way that
