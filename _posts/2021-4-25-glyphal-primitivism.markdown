Here we have suggestions of abstract symbols in natural scenes. The characters of written language appear to us in an *organic* context.

*Rousseau-esque but with a departure from folk/animist themes.*

In the above image, we instead see the symbols of notation: tally marks are imagined from distant tree trunks. The letter/numeral "X" from woody limbs emerging from the water. The scene is strongly segmented by various natural elements.

*Titled "OK" because the blossoms suggest alphabetical letters.*
