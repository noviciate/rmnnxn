What I like about that Minolta Maxxum I mentioned at the start is that it was on the cusp of film and digital. Cameras of the Maxxum series were loaded with digital comforts like eye-start, multi-zone predictive focus and more. I have since bought two updated versions of the camera that I started with for a combined sum of about $40 and I go around with Ektar 100 in one and Portra 800 in the other [and a Fujifilm mirrorless sometimes too]. Most of the Maxxum series cameras are dirt cheap and in pristine condition on the used market. There is no hipster tax because they do not have archetypal, nostalgia-inducing design features like an all metal body (ironically, my digital Fujifilm does), sharp angles or mechanical clacks/cerchunks or other noises that people find satisfying about older cameras. Instead they have a curvy, "ergonomic" feel and are made of plastic with screens for settings and indications.
