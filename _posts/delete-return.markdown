*Improving my work by removing distractions*

I began my recent interest in photography as a "mission creep" away from painting. I was initially recording textures and scenes for practice and inspiration while riding my bike around the Rochester metro area.

I have concluded that for me, pursuit of meaning and pursuit of monetary income are best kept as separate endeavors.

For me, the visual arts are a tool to express something I find difficult to express in words because a picture can hold ideas in ways that words cannot. 

I commit to my disregard for the binary presupposition that artistic endeavors are either hobby or occupational. My pursuit is deliberately neither.
