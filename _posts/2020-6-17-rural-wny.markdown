<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic;">... as it pertains to the west side of Rochester in Monroe and Orleans counties.</span>

The land is flat, save for occasional dips and inclines - sloping gently downward toward Lake Ontario. Wooded areas are mostly privately owned with young, stick-like trees and densly packed shrubery. All between and beyond the interstices of suburban development.

I think that there are scenes of visual intrigue to be had here, if you have a feel for subtlty.
 Old barns, silos and farmhouses sit proud atop gentle hills. There are many creeks that flow north and join together before draining into Lake Ontario. The dips and and open fields hold the morning fog of spring and autumn. The orchards in spring hold acres of blossoms. The harvest season has it's own beauty as leaves turn color and farm stands have endless varieties of pumpkins and gourds. Winter inundates the scenery with fluffy "lake effect" snow.

These atributes may be familiar to those who live on the north side of the lake in Ontario, Canada and likely throughout the Great Lakes. There are also Field Stone, Carpenter Gothic and Victorian style houses and I might explore some of that in a future series.
