<span style="color: grey; font-style: italic;">The process of developing my own voice through photography.</span>

I began my recent interest in photography as a "mission creep" away from painting. I was initially recording textures and scenes for practice and inspiration while riding my bike around the Rochester metro area. I began to pay close attention to composition and decided to start using a forgotten SLR camera that was in the family instead of just my smartphone; a Minolta Maxxum with an unshot roll of Kodak Gold 200 that I found in the pocket of its carrying case.

Riding around on my 8-speed, my gaze fell upon the various anachronisms in the Rochester landscape. Sometimes you realize that there was a whole neighborhood where the parking lots or interchanges are in the city. Similar developments happened in the countryside with suburbanization. Some structures of heritage and pockets of nature become enveloped by a scene that is unsympathetic to them.

I found satisfaction in unifying the elements of the scene within my viewfinder, whether in the [exurbs](https://grist.org/sprawl/2011-08-26-the-curse-of-the-exurbs/), the parks or the city proper. Disappointment with the state of things around me and within myself could be turned into something productive. Not everything was a victim to lousy urban planning, plenty of what's good is preserved or revitalized, and so I captured whatever I felt was worthwhile to me, good, bad or inbetween. 

I was not yet aware of the [New Topographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Topographics) exhibition or any subsequent developments in photography in its wake. I was simply trying to boost my skills in composition for painting but stumbled on a more effective way to say what I wanted to say. The idea of finding [beauty in the banal](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/08/new-topographics-photographs-american-landscapes) resonates with me and many others.

> * "...luminance, radiance over this landscape of mistakes."
> * "wholeness in the picture is a metaphor for wholeness in life"

Mirroring of New Topographics is often found on social media, particularly in the film photography communities. In a reddit [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/g416as/new_topographics_cliche_or_not_why/), users note this and point out that some of the *influencer* film photographers and their imitators are more after a sense of nostalgia. They are not coming to terms with blight on a disappearing natural landscape like the photographers associated with NT. The shared subject matter is no longer new, it's gathering patina. More appropriately, it is William Eggleston (who was not a fan of NT, despite sharing an affinity for the "mundane") that is the true influence because his work has a higher level of sentimentality, a sibling of nostalgia.

But nostalgia was a topic of interest in NT aswell. It was the motivation of Bernd Becher who together with his wife Hilla, captured images of aging industrial structures before they disappear from the landscape. Hilla had an interest in typology and so their collaboration was a attenuation of the subtle

New Topographics itself has been noted for its use of [irony](https://americansuburbx.com/2012/05/new-topographics-landscape-and-the-west-irony-and-critique-in-new-topographic-photography-2005.html) while showing human development's active disturbance of nature, though, not the only topic as evidenced by the Bechers. The scenes of the *west* were easily recognized as the antonym to Ansel Adams' raw, rugged and unperturbed nature scenes of that region and Adams had a disdain for Stephen Shore's work. Robert Adams explained in the above video, that he initially avoided the manmade scenes to get the Ansel Adams style nature shots. Eventually, he gravitated toward, and found beauty in the *man-altered landscapes*. Yet, an emphasis on the importance of nature remained the same and had to be adapted to the unavoidable reality; the disturbance was aesthetically integrated.

And just like we can "save the planet" by minimizing our distinction between manufactured and natural, we can fight the trappings of nostalgia by treating the old and new as equals and not rivals. The *good times* were unsustainable and that is why we moved on. We can revist them to reintegrate that which can be saved and learn how to create a better future, improved technology or more compelling art.

Upstate NY used to be a frontier. Before Ansel Adams, there was the Hudson River School painters whose idealized the region's raw nature of the 1800s. Agricultural and industrial boom  In the 20th Century, people didn't want what happened to Niagara Falls to happen to places like Yosemite

I titled this *Accidentally New Topographics* because as a novice to photography, I had no intention of imitating a particular style but unwittingly did so in some aspects. Originality always remains elusive and therefore it is not a realistic goal in and of itself. We all share the same world and we all have cameras, essentially. This is actually one of the reasons for my "mission creep" away from painting, infact. Taking a photo is deceptively simple in comparisson to painting and so I feel that the "handmade" aspect of painting can potentially be a distraction. *[I will elaborate further in the future.]* Anyways, this post is meant to triangulate my work with similar work of the past and present. When I look through the viewfinder, I am trying to have a dialogue with natural and manmade, old and new, dissapointment and aspiration.

Towers that were formerly the headquarters of influencial companies mirror the tombstones of Mt Hope Cemetery, the resting place of once prominent people who called the city their home. The trees flank either side of the scene like stage curtains. Mt Hope Cemetery was once rural and despite subsequent urban/suburban development, Rochester still retains some green spaces and many trees (though the natural wetland environment of the area has largely been destroyed since the arrival of settlers but that is another story).</span>
